# my dotfiles

The dotfiles here are composed of various configurations and choices I have made - and continue to make - while playing with Linux. They include the installation and configuration of `fish`, `nvim` and a few applications I like to use. 

## Usage

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/AdnanValdes/dotfiles.git
cd ./dotfiles
./install
```

If you don't want to install all the programs I use, go to the `app_installer.sh` script and remove (or add!) whatever you want.
